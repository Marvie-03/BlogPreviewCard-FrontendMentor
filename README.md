### What I learned

I Tried out CSS variables and it was amazing

```css
:root {
  --primary: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --grey: hsl(0, 0%, 50%);
  --black: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
/* Use Case */
p{
 color: var(--grey);
}
```


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools - CSS Positioning](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - This helped me when I was looking to postion the elements in the card.
